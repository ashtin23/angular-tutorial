# Teach Yourself
For this project, I decided to teach myself AngularJS.

## Why AngularJS?
After perusing through mountains of job postings, I noticed a common trend: companies
want employees who know Angular. 

## What problem does it solve?
AngularJS is a framework similar to ReactJS. It was created by Google, and is completely
open source. It was designed to build dynamic web apps, with the goal of simplifying and structuring JavaScript code.

## Alternatives
Developers may also use any number of frameworks, to include: React, Vue, Ember, Polymer, or Backbone. Due to its design, AngularJS is expressive, readable, and quick to develop, compared to the alternatives. AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. Every feature can be modified or altered to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs.

## History
Interestingly enough, AngularJS was actually the side project of a Google Employee by the name of Miško Hevery. He and a few others contributed to it and eventually released it open source in 2010. It is mostly maintained by Google.

## My thoughts
AngularJS is a complex framework, but eases the overall process of creating a website once it is learned. I am hoping to put more time and effort into learning this framework as I continue my job search. 

## Resources
The most valuable resource was certainly the AngularJS documentation, which is where I discovered the tutorial to create my first app. However, there are multitudes of resources on AngularJS, whether on YouTube or elsewhere, due to its rising popularity within the development community.
